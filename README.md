# 🧠 The Insight Layer

**The Insight Layer** is a new operational category for context-aware, AI-augmented knowledge delivery in organizations. It addresses the persistent challenge of information overload, fragmented memory, and disconnected decision-making by enabling just-in-time insight surfacing — across teams, tools, and time.

This repository serves as a home for the concept, community resources, and future tooling related to the Insight Layer.

## What Is the Insight Layer?

> *“We are drowning in information, but starved for insight.”*

The Insight Layer is designed to change that.

It acts as an organizational memory system — bridging data, decisions, and context — to proactively surface the most relevant insights when they’re needed most. Rather than replacing human judgment, the Insight Layer strengthens it by delivering contextual, reusable knowledge directly into workflows.

## Why It Matters

The Insight Layer helps solve:

- Cognitive overload from scattered tools
- Repeated work and forgotten lessons
- Shallow GenAI outputs lacking context
- Poor reuse of organizational knowledge

It’s the missing link between OLTP, OLAP, and GenAI agentic memory — enabling long-term, dynamic insight reuse.

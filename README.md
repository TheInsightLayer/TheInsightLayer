# üß† The Insight Layer

**The Insight Layer** is a new operational category for context-aware, AI-augmented knowledge delivery in organizations. It addresses the persistent challenge of information overload, fragmented memory, and disconnected decision-making by enabling just-in-time insight surfacing ‚Äî across teams, tools, and time.

This repository serves as a home for the concept, community resources, and future tooling related to the Insight Layer.

## What Is the Insight Layer?

> *‚ÄúWe are drowning in information, but starved for insight.‚Äù*

The Insight Layer is designed to change that.

It acts as an organizational memory system ‚Äî bridging data, decisions, and context ‚Äî to proactively surface the most relevant insights when they‚Äôre needed most. Rather than replacing human judgment, the Insight Layer strengthens it by delivering contextual, reusable knowledge directly into workflows.

## Why It Matters

The Insight Layer helps solve:

- Cognitive overload from scattered tools
- Repeated work and forgotten lessons
- Shallow GenAI outputs lacking context
- Poor reuse of organizational knowledge

It‚Äôs the missing link between OLTP, OLAP, and GenAI agentic memory ‚Äî enabling long-term, dynamic insight reuse.

## Coming Soon

- Starter prompt libraries for integrating GenAI + Insight Layer
- InsightUnit schema and tagging framework
- Sample implementation architecture and API references
